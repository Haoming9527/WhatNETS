# NETS x WhatsApp Integration Prototype

This project is a prototype developed for the PolyFinTech100 API Hackathon 2025, where we proposed a strategic collaboration between NETS and WhatsApp. The objective was to increase adoption and usage of NETS among youth by integrating NETS payment functionality directly into a familiar messaging platform, WhatsApp. The prototype demonstrates how this integration could provide a seamless and convenient way for users to make payments during their conversations.

The interface is built to simulate WhatsApp. Within the chat interface, users will find a "NETS" button. When clicked, this button redirects them to a second page where they can input the amount they wish to pay. Upon submitting the amount, it will generates a QR code based on the entered amount. This QR code can be scanned by the payer using the NETS Payment Simulator App to complete the transaction.

This prototype is not an official integration of NETS or WhatsApp, and is built solely for educational and demonstration purposes. It was personally developed as part of the hackathon submission to illustrate the core idea and technical feasibility of the proposed solution.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
